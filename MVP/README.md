# Animal Shelter Adoption Classification.  
We concluded based on our analysis that the best ways to rise an animal's odds of getting adopted are the following:
1. Give them a name: when animal have a name it may form an emotinal bond with potintal owners.
2. Neutred/Spayed them: Potintal owners prefere Neutred/Spayed animals over intact ones.
3. Being young: If an animal is young then their odds are higher than older animals.
